# Welcome to Novo

The renaissance of programmable money
Novo reimagines the classic UTXO-based scalable technology by refining its core infrastructure and virtual machine. This enhancement unleashes the technology's considerably untapped potential for parallelizable transaction processing and Layer-1 programmability.

You can try it out using the following command.

```
docker run -d -p 8088:80 --name welcome-to-novo docker/welcome-to-novo
